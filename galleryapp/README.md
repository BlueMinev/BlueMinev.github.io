# 527-api-app
My year 2 Web Development assignment 1. the aim is to research and develop a Web-based client application that uses the publicAPI (v.2) of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A) to search and browse the museum's collection.
My REST API client must:
1. Be a dynamic, fully responsive, standards compliant, web page
2. Follow the Single Page Application (SPA) design pattern
3. Provide an HTML form for users to enter a search term
4. Use asynchronous HTTP requests to query the API with the search term
5. Dynamically display the search results (image, title, description, date)
6. Follow best practice with regard to coding standards, usability and accessibility
7. Use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks or external libraries)
